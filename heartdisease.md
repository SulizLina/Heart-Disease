### Our goal:

The goal of collecting a dataset on heart diseases is to gather relevant information about the factors that influence the risk of gaining heart diseases. The results of analyzing this dataset will be utilized in various beneficial ways, research advancements, researchers work towards improving the usnderstanding and management of heart disease, and increasing awareness among the public regarding the common factors that can contribute to heart diseases.

### Classification goal:

The aim is to predict whether a person is at risk of having a certain type or level of heart disease based on their vital signals, such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The objective is to build a predictive model that accurately categorizes individuals into two groups: those likely to have a future heart disease (labeled as 1) and those unlikely to have a future heart disease (labeled as 0).

### Defect prediction goal:

The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify individuals into categories based on the presence or absence of a specific heart defect. This can aid in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Identifying these defects early allows healthcare professionals to intervene promptly and provide appropriate medical interventions.

Overall, our Data set for heart disease provides healthcare professionals with a powerful tool for diagnosing, classifying, and predicting heart disease.

### Data Type:
Our dataset has 14 objects "attributes" (see Table 1).
Our class label is the target. It is binary type which has value 0= no disease , 1=disease.
